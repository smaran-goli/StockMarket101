Investing in stocks is a very important financial strategy in today’s world, as it enables one to grow with the economy, also to make money in two ways. Starting early is the key to becoming a successful investor. For example, educating students about investment is very important, and presently, in schools, the only focus is to teach formulas of compounding, hence they end up in between some numeric values, the significance of which they may not understand.

Through virtual world simulation, we want to give our players the experience required, also help them understand what compounding and investing actually means. Our game can be a wonderful platform for potential investors to build their own portfolio and gain the experience and feel of placing trade and orders.

*   Description of our game and introduce the game rules
    *   The investor will be asked to:
          *   create his/her account with “name”, then an account will be created by assigning a "Personal account number” 
                                                           
                                                           (or)
                                                           
             *   The "Personal account number" is set to 1000 at first. So whenever a new user creates an account, 
                 the "Personal account number" is incremented by 1(i.e., 1001, 1002..etc)

          *   login into an existing account with “name” and “Personal account number” as input \
   
  

    *   After creating/logging into his/her account, the user will be redirected to the main menu consisting of 9 different options. 

        _(New player starts with virtual cash of 100,000 HKD in his/her \
          portfolio account, while an already registered user can \
          view all his previous activity.)_

    *   **The main menu** – it consists of 9 different options and gives the user at most flexibility to navigate through various features of the game. Here are                               the 9 options explained briefly:
        *   "1. Display all stocks." - Used for refreshing all stock values and display it to the user. All stocks are displayed with their current par value

            _(Player gets to experiment with these stocks by investing in virtual stocks_)

        *   "2. Do you want to buy/sell stocks." – Used for buying or selling a specific stock

             If, yes

           *   Player would choose to buy or sell
              *   Player would input the name and number of stocks he wants to buy 
                                               (or)
              *   Player would input the name and number of stocks he wants to sell
                                             
              
        *   "3. Display your stocks." – to display all stocks in the user’s portfolio with quantity
        *   "4. View Transaction history." - Display all the transactions made by the user, including the date and time of the transaction
        *   “5. Display minimum and maximum value of all stocks till date.” - Display the minimum and maximum value for each of stock
        *   "6. current day profit/loss for each stock." - Used for displaying profits for each transaction made so far
